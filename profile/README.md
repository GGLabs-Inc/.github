> *"If Web2 monetizes clicks, Web3 should monetize actions."*

### 🚀 Building at ETHGlobal HackMoney 2026

**YellowMeter OS** is the infrastructure for **Action-based Economic Sessions**. We are redefining how value is measured and exchanged in Web3, moving from a "pay-per-transaction" to a "pay-per-action" model.

### ⚡ What we are building

An infrastructure layer enabling:
- ⏱️ **Zero-latency actions**
- ⛽ **Gasless interactions**
- 🔄 **One-transaction settlement**

Enabling new business models for AI, DePIN, Gaming, and APIs where every micro-action counts.
